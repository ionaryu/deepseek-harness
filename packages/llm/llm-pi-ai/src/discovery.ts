/**
 * Answering "which models can this provider serve?" for the configuration
 * surface's "fetch available models" action.
 *
 * A route the installed pi-ai catalog ships is answered **from that catalog**,
 * with no network call at all: pi-ai's registry is the authoritative list for
 * its own providers, and it carries the capacities a listing endpoint would
 * not disclose. Only a route the catalog does not describe — a gateway, a
 * self-hosted server — is interrogated over the wire. A catalog route may set
 * `discoverFromEndpoint` to be interrogated instead, which is how a provider
 * that added models after the installed pi-ai release shows them; its reply is
 * enriched from the installed entries of the same ids, and carries nothing for
 * ids the registry does not describe.
 *
 * Neither path is a catalog refresh. Nothing here is stored: the request
 * carries a draft the user is still editing, and the reply is candidate
 * metadata the surface offers for adoption. `settings.yaml` remains the only
 * thing that decides what a route serves.
 *
 * OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic Messages protocols are interrogated through
 * their native model-listing endpoints. The parser accepts the standard
 * `data` array and the enriched `models` map some compatible gateways expose.
 * Every other protocol reports that it cannot be interrogated so the surface
 * falls back to hand-entry rather than guessing its response fields.
